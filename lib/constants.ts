      ALESTM (Automatic Laser Exposure, Scanning & Temperature Mapping) System is an upgraded version of VDP-LES and can be used for many applications e.g. Non Contact method of sample heating and Thermal Mapping during the heating process and afterwards, in addition to Photo Thermal Studies.

      Customers can bring samples in the form of Live Animal (Mice, Rat or Rabbit) or on Micro Well Plate and Petri Dish. Laser Power Density (on sample) can be varied by adjusting the "Laser Beam Diameter" or "Laser Power".

      Our system allows the use of Well Plates and Petri Dishes for samples, with precise exposure to laser beams at predefined times and locations. We provide Micro Well Plate holders for 6/12/24/48/96 configurations. Customers can choose one or multiple wells and assign the same or different exposure times.

      The user-friendly GUI includes checks at every step to avoid user errors. The system includes Near Infra-Red (NIR) Fiber Coupled Laser with options to use one or many lasers (one at a time).

      Thermal Mapping of the exposed sample includes temperature palettes for both video and images, with temperature data from each pixel exportable to Excel for further analysis.

      FSOC can deliver a wireless-access solution for quick deployment with more bandwidth capacity, security features, and less power consumption than traditional point-to-point microwave links. With FSO, a high-power laser source converts data into laser pulses and sends them through a lens system and into the atmosphere. The laser travels to the other side of the link and goes through a receiver lens system. A high-sensitivity photo detector then converts these laser pulses back into electronic data that can be processed.
